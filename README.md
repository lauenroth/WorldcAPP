## About

WorldcAPP is an app for World and Euro Cups. It shows matches, scores and standings. Furthermore, users have the possibility to bet the result of each match and compete with others. There is also an integrated chat that helps people talking about matches and the tournament.

The first version of WorldcAPP was developed for the World Cup in Brazil. This repository was started right before the Euro 2016 though.
